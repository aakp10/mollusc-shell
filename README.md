# mollusc-shell
Exoskeleton shell around (soft) UNIX commands.

**Obviously this was done as a part of my assignment.**   

Just like the mollusc phylum which has a hard exoskeleton protecting a tender creature, 
this wasn't any complex assignment rather a revision for some of the most basic UNIX system calls.
